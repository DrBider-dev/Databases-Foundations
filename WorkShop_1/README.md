# Project: Residential Complex Management

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to design a database for managing a residential complex. The main objective is to facilitate the management of residents, their guests, the reservation and usage of common areas, as well as effective communication between residents and the administration of the complex.

To guide the design, a survey was conducted with 15 students, whose responses were analyzed to develop a list of "user stories". These stories helped clearly define the systemâ€™s specific requirements. Based on these requirements, the entity-relationship model (ERM) methodology was employed to create a robust and comprehensive database design that enables efficient management of daily activities within the residential complex.

## Objectives

- **Resident Management:** Registration and maintenance of basic resident information.
- **Guest Management:** Registration of guest data and control of their visits.
- **Common Areas:** Administration and reservation of common areas such as halls, courts, and other facilities.
- **Communication with Administration:** Facilitate interaction and tracking of requests or complaints from residents to the administration.

## Methodology

1. **Surveys:** 15 students were surveyed to gain insights into needs and preferences related to residential complex management.
2. **User Stories:** Based on the results, a list of user stories was developed to define the system's specific requirements.
3. **Entity-Relationship Model (ERM):** This methodology was used to design a complete database model, ensuring that all required system functionalities are covered.
